# Colombia-unemployment-prediction

This project analyzes historical unemployment rates in Colombia (2000–2023) and predicts future trends 
from 2024 to 2028 using a polynomial regression model of degree 3. 
It includes data preprocessing, model evaluation (R² = 0.66), and visualizations.

## Features

1. Data transformation and cleaning
2.  How Has Unemployment Evolved Across Latin America Since 2000?
